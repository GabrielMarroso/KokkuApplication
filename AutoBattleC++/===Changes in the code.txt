= As I was progressing through some error fixing in the Auto Battle project,
  I realized I did't have the expertise to clean all of the code. So I started
  digging knowledge and from C++ courses in order to understand where were
  my flaws. Meanwhile, I started my own project (see console RPG folder) to learn 
  more about how to develop a console RPG game where I implemented character creation,
  load, save and character sheet functionalities.
